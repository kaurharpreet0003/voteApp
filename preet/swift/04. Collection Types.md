## Array

### Exercise 4.1

Create an empty array with values of type Int and assign it to a variable in as many ways as you can think of (there's at least 4 ways).

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>
  
```Swift
var myArray1: Array<Int> = []
var myArray2: [Int] = []
var myArray3 = Array<Int>()
var myArray4 = [Int]()
```
</details>

### Exercise 4.2

Create an array containing the integer values 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, and 42. There are at least 4 ways to do this, as well.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```Swift
var myArray1: Array<Int> = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]
var myArray2: [Int] = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]
var myArray3 = Array<Int>(arrayLiteral: 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42)
var myArray4 = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]
```
</details>

### Exercise 4.3

Create an array that cannot be modified containing the integer values 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, and 42.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```Swift
let myImmutableArray = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]
```
</details>

### Exercise 4.4

Add the values 1138, 1337, and 4711 to the end of the following array:

```Swift
var stuff = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]
```

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```Swift
var stuff = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]

stuff.append(contentsOf: [1138, 1337, 4711])

// Or...

stuff += [1138, 1337, 4711]

// Or...

stuff = stuff + [1138, 1337, 4711]
```
</details>

### Exercise 4.5

Replace the value 15 with the value 17 in the following array:

```Swift
var numbers = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]
```

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```Swift
var numbers = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]

numbers[2] = 17
```
</details>

### Exercise 4.6

Replace the values 15, 16, and 23 with the values 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 in the following array:

```Swift
var numbers = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]
```

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```Swift
var numbers = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]

numbers[2...4] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```
</details>

### Exercise 4.7

Create an array containing 10 sheep "🐑" strings. Then print the length of the array.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```Swift
let sheep = "🐑"

var lotsOfSheep = Array(repeating: sheep, count: 10)

print(lotsOfSheep.count)
```
</details>

### Exercise 4.8

Write at least one variant of removing the last element in an array, where you don't know the length.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>
  
```Swift
var electricCars = ["tesla", "t-ford"]
electricCars.removeLast()

print(electricCars)
// ["tesla"]
```
</details>

## Set

### Exercise 4.9

Given the following sets:

```Swift
let houseAnimals: Set = ["🐶", "🐱"]
let farmAnimals: Set = ["🐮", "🐔", "🐑", "🐶", "🐱"]
let cityAnimals: Set = ["🐦", "🐭"]
```

Use set operations to...

1. ...determine whether the set of house animals is a subset of farm animals.
2. ...determine whether the set of farm animals is a superset of house animals.
3. ...determine if the set of farm animals is disjoint with city animals. 
4. ...create a set that only contains farm animals that are not also house animals.
5. ...create a set that contains all the animals from all sets.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```Swift
let houseAnimals: Set = ["🐶", "🐱"]
let farmAnimals: Set = ["🐮", "🐔", "🐑", "🐶", "🐱"]
let cityAnimals: Set = ["🐦", "🐭"]

// 1.
houseAnimals.isSubset(of: farmAnimals)

// 2.
farmAnimals.isSuperset(of: houseAnimals)

// 3.
farmAnimals.isDisjoint(with: cityAnimals)

// 4.
let nonHousingFarmAnimals = farmAnimals.subtracting(houseAnimals)

// 5.
let allAnimals = farmAnimals.union(houseAnimals).union(cityAnimals)
```

## Dictionary

### Exercise 4.10

Create an empty dictionary with keys of type String and values of type Int and assign it to a variable in as many ways as you can think of (there's at least 4 ways).

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```Swift
let myDictionary1: Dictionary<String, Int> = [:]
let myDictionary2: [String: Int] = [:]
let myDictionary3 = Dictionary<String, Int>()
let myDictionary4 = [String: Int]()
```
</details>

### Exercise 4.11

Create a mutable dictionary named `secretIdentities` where the key value pairs are "Hulk" -> "Bruce Banner", "Batman" -> "Bruce Wayne", and "Superman" -> "Clark Kent".

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```Swift
var secretIdentities = [
  "Hulk": "Bruce Banner",
  "Batman": "Bruce Wayne",
  "Superman": "Clark Kent"
]
```
</details>

### Exercise 4.12

Given the dictionary from exercise 4.10, print the secret identity of Batman. Spoiler: It's Bruce Wayne.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```Swift
var secretIdentities = [
  "Hulk": "Bruce Banner",
  "Batman": "Bruce Wayne",
  "Superman": "Clark Kent"
]

print(secretIdentities["Batman"])
```
</details>

### Exercise 4.13

Given the dictionary from exercise 4.10, replace the secret identity of the Hulk with "David Banner", which was the Hulk's civilian name on the TV show for some reason. I guess they were not fans of alliteration, but I digress. 

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```Swift
var secretIdentities = [
  "Hulk": "Bruce Banner",
  "Batman": "Bruce Wayne",
  "Superman": "Clark Kent"
]
secretIdentities["Hulk"] = "David Banner"
print(secretIdentities["Hulk"])
```
</details>

### Exercise 4.14

Given the dictionary from exercise 4.10, iterate (with a for loop) over all the secret identities and print both the values and the keys.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```Swift
let secretIdentities = [
  "Hulk": "Bruce Banner",
  "Batman": "Bruce Wayne",
  "Superman": "Clark Kent"
]

for (name, secretName) in secretIdentities {
    print("\(name) is really \(secretName)")
}
```
