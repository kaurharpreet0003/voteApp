# 1. The Basics

## Constants and Variables

### Exercise 1.1

Declare a floating point variable that represents temperature and assign the current
temperature to it. If you don't have a thermometer, guess the temperature. :-)

Then assign a different temperature to it. Pick one at random, it doesn't matter.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>
    
```Swift
var currentTemperature = 18.2
print(currentTemperature)

currentTemperature = 12.6
print(currentTemperature)
```
</details>

### Exercise 1.2

Declare a constant integer value that represents the number of seconds in an hour
and assign that number to it on the same line.

Then try to assign a different value to the constant. Why doesn't it work?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```Swift
let secondsInAnHour = 3600
print(secondsInAnHour)

// This does not work, because it is a constant and thus cannot be changed.
secondsInAnHour = 1337
```
</details>

### Exercise 1.3

Declare an integer variable with an explicit type annotation and then one without.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```Swift
var someVariable: Int
var someOtherVariable = 1337
```
</details>

### Exercise 1.4

Declare a constant integer value that represents the number of wheels of a car.
*Don't* assign it a value on the same line.

On the next line, assign a value to the constant. Why does this work?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>
It works, because the constant can be assigned to once, but it doesn't have to be on the same line.
```Swift
let numberOfWheels: Int
numberOfWheels = 4
print(numberOfWheels)
```
</details>

### Exercise 1.5

Declare the constant Ï€ using the name Ï€, which you can type by pressing `alt-p`.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```Swift
let Ï€ = 3.141592654

print(Ï€)
```
</details>

### Exercise 1.6

Declare a variable using an emoji in the name.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```Swift
var ðŸ’© = "turd"
```
</details>

### Exercise 1.7

Print a variable using the `print()` function.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```Swift
var year = 2016
print(year)
```
</details>

### Exercise 1.8

What is the maximum value that can be stored in an Int16? Write the code that prints the maximum value of the Int16 type.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```Swift
print(Int16.max)
```
</details>

### Exercise 1.9

What type is the constant pi in the example below? Why?

```Swift
let pi = 3 + 0.141592654
```

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```Swift
let pi = 3 + 0.141592654

// Print the type of pi. The compiler inferred that it's a Double.
print(type(of: pi))
```
</details>

### Exercise 1.10

What happens if you try the following code? Why?

```Swift
let myNumber: UInt = -17
```

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>
You get the following compiler error:

```
negative integer '-17' overflows when stored into unsigned type 'UInt'
```

UInt means Unsigned Integer, which means it cannot be negative.

```Swift
print(Int.min)
print(Int.max)

print(UInt.min)
print(UInt.max)
```
</details>


### Exercise 1.11

What happens if you try the following code? Why?

```Swift
let bigNumber: Int16 = 32767 + 1
```

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>
The compiler reports an overflow error. The max value of Int16 is 32767.
</details>

### Exercise 1.12

Why does the following code not work? What do you need to add to it to make it work,
if we absolutely want to store this value as an integer, i.e. 3, but we don't want
to change the type of the variables?

```Swift
let pi = 3.141592654
let approximatePi: Int = pi
```

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

`pi` is a Double value. It must be explicitly converted to an Int.
```Swift
let pi = 3.141592654
let approximatePi: Int = Int(pi)

print(approximatePi)
```
</details>

### Exercise 1.13 EXTRA CREDIT

The following code will print `true`, which means that valueA and valueB are equal. Why are they equal?
(The `<<` is the bitshift left operator.)

```Swift
let valueA: Int16 = -0x8000
let valueB: Int16 = 0x4000 << 1

print(valueA == valueB)
```

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Because integers are represented as two-complement values, 0x4000 << 1 for a 16 bit signed integer ends up being 0x8000 which is actually -32768. -0x8000 also ends up being represented as 0x8000 when the compiler stuffs the value into the 16 bit signed integer.

```Swift
print("0x4000 << 1 = \(0x4000 << 1)")

let valueA: Int16 = -0x8000
let valueB: Int16 = 0x4000 << 1

print("valueA = \(valueA)")
print("valueB = \(valueB)")

print(valueA == valueB)
```
</details>

## Comments

### Exercise 1.14

There are two types of comments. Single-line and multiline comments. Write one of both.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```Swift
// Single-line comment.
/*
 * Multiline comment.
 */
```
</details>

### Exercise 1.15

In Swift multiline comments can be nested. Write a nested multiline comment.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```Swift
/* This is the start of the first multiline comment.
 * /* This is the second, nested multiline comment. */
 * This is the end of the first multiline comment. */
```
</details>

## Semicolons

This is not really an exercise, but try to avoid using semicolons. If you have to use a semicolon, you are probably doing something wrong. :-) It's generally preferred code style to write each statement on its own line.

## Tuples

### Exercise 1.16

Assign a tuple with two values in it to a constant named `player`. The values could represent the number of a hockey player and the name of the hockey player. For example, Igor Larionov whose number used to be 8.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```Swift
let player = (8, "Igor Larionov")

// Or, you could name the elements.
let player = (number: 8, name: "Igor Larionov")

print(player)
```
</details>

### Exercise 1.17

OK, now you have a `player` tuple. Decompose (i.e. split) the number and the name into two constants named `number` and `name`. This could be done in at least three ways. Try all three.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```Swift
let player = (number: 8, name: "Igor Larionov")

// First solution
let (number, name) = player

// Second solution
let number = player.0
let name = player.1

// Third solution
let number = player.number
let name = player.name
```
</details>

## Optionals

### Exercise 1.18

Can a constant have an optional type? If you're not sure, try it and see what happens.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>
Yes, a constant can have an optional type:

```Swift
let value: Int? = nil
print(value)

let otherValue: Int? = 6
print(otherValue)
```
</details>

### Exercise 1.19

Why doesn't this work? What needs to be added to `value` on the second line for this to work?

```Swift
let value: Int? = 17
let banana: Int = value
```

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>
You would need to force unwrap `value`.

```Swift
let value: Int? = 17
let banana: Int = value!
```
</details>

### Exercise 1.20

If `value` in the previous exercise had been nil, what would have happened if you force unwrapped `value`?

```Swift
let value: Int? = nil
let banana: Int = value!
```

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>
The program would crash. You cannot force unwrap `nil`.
</details>

### Exercise 1.21

What would be a better way to assign `value` to the `banana` constant?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>
Optional binding using `if let` would be a better way.

```Swift
let value: Int? = 17
if let unwrappedValue = value {
    let banana: Int = unwrappedValue
}
```

You can even use the same name for the unwrapped value. I know, it seems weird at first, but you get used to it.

```Swift
let value: Int? = 17
if let value = value {
    let banana: Int = value
}
```
