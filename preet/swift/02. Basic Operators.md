# 2. Basic Operators

## Assignment Operator

We have already used the assignment operator for simple values.

```Swift
var value = 17
value = 1337
```

### Exercise 2.1

What would happen if you used the assignment operator in the following way? (This is mainly an exercise for Objective-C coders.)

```Swift
var value = 17

if value = 19 {
    print("Whatever and stuff.")
}
```

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>
It wouldn't compile, because the assignment operator does not result in a value, unlike in other languages, such as C and Objective-C.

This means that you also cannot "chain" assignments such as the following in Swift:

```Swift
var a: Int
var b: Int

a = b = 17
```

You'd get the following compiler error, where () means Void, or no value.

```
ERROR at line 12, col 7: cannot assign value of type '()' to type 'Int'
a = b = 17
    ~~^~~~
```

## Arithmetic Operators

Everyone knows how these work. They're basically the same as in other lanugages.

+, -, *, -

### Exercise 2.2

Use all the arithmetic operators in a single statement and assign the result to a constant.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```Swift
// Example
let result = 1 + 2 * 5 / 3 - 1337

print(result)
```
</details>

### Exercise 2.3

Append the string "Larionov" to the end of the string "Igor " and assign the resulting string to a constant. 

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```Swift
let name = "Igor " + "Larionov"
print(name)
```
</details>

### Exercise 2.3

What happens if you try the unary increment operator (e.g. `value++`) from other C-like languages?

```Swift
var value = 0
value++
```
<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>
It doesn't compile, because ++ was removed in Swift 3. ++ and -- were somewhat error prone and had weird semantics that compiler people in general don't like. You will have to do this instead:

```Swift
var value = 0
value += 1
```
</details>

### Exercise 2.4

How do you check if two strings are equal in Swift?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>
Unlike in Objective-C or C, you can use the equality operator `==`.

```Swift
let value = "banana"
print("banana" == value)
```
</details>

### Exercise 2.5

Let's compare some tuples. Guess if these are true or false:

```Swift
(1, "zebra") < (2, "apple")

(2, "zebra") < (1, "apple")

(3, "apple") < (3, "bird")

(4, "dog") == (4, "dog")

(4, "dog") == (4, "cat")
```

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```Swift
(1, "zebra") < (2, "apple") // true

(2, "zebra") < (1, "apple") // false

(3, "apple") < (3, "bird") // true

(4, "dog") == (4, "dog") // true

(4, "dog") == (4, "cat") // false
```
</details>

## Ternary Conditional Operator

### Exercise 2.6

Use the ternary conditional operator to assign the correct number of days in a year to the constant `daysInYear` depending on the value of `leapYear`.

```Swift
var leapYear = true
```


<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```Swift
var leapYear = true
var daysInYear = leapYear ? 366 : 365
```
</details>

## Nil-Coalescing Operator

Coalescing is not the easiest word to spell. You could think of it as the default operator, I guess.

### Exercise 2.7

Use the nil-coalescing operator `??` to provide a fallback value if a value for the optional variable `name` has not been provided.

```Swift
// The first name is optional in this example.
var firstName: String? = nil

// The last name is however not optional.
var lastName: String = "Jones"

// Use ?? operator here to provide a fallback value,
// if no first name has been provided.
// For example, the default value could be "Dr.",
// because this code is to be used at a medical conference.
var name: String = firstName

name += " " + lastName

print(name)
```

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```Swift
var firstName: String? = nil
var lastName: String = "Jones"

var name: String = firstName ?? "Dr."
name += " " + lastName

print(name)
```
</details>

## Range Operators

### Exercise 2.8: Closed Range Operator

Define a closed range, e.g. for an amplifier volume knob that goes from 0 to 11. The range should include both 0 and 11, because this amplifier really does go to 11.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```Swift
let volumeRange = 0...11

print(volumeRange)

// Pattern matching operator ~= can be used to check
// if a value is included in the range
print(volumeRange ~= 2)
print(volumeRange ~= 11)
print(volumeRange ~= 12)
```
</details>

### Exercise 2.9: Open Range Operator

Define an open range, e.g. for an amplifier volume knob that goes from 0 to 10. The range should include both 0 and 10, but not 11.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```Swift
let volumeRange = 0..<11

print(volumeRange)

// Pattern matching operator ~= can be used to check
// if a value is included in the range
print(volumeRange ~= 2)
print(volumeRange ~= 10)
print(volumeRange ~= 11)
```
